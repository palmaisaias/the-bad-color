    title: "The Mother in Mourning",
    text: `Her love for music and lavender was eclipsed when her husband Edward was killed in a senseless act of violence during a late-night store robbery. She was left holding their 7-month-old son, Vincent, knowing he would grow up never hearing his father's voice. Overwhelmed by grief and the ugliness of the world, she became one of the first to believe that a village could be built away from it all — where children could grow in safety and innocence.`

    title: "The Father Who Lost His Place",
    text: `Edgar loved puzzles and logic,
always finding structure where
others saw chaos. But when he
was caught in a workplace
shooting at his office, several
of his closest colleagues —
people he’d spent years beside
— were killed in moments. He
survived, but could never sit
at a desk without hearing the
echoes of gunfire. With
Alexander, his young son, he
turned to the village,
believing it to be the only
place left where order and
peace could endure.`

    title: "The Outdoorsman Shattered",
    text: `Strong, devoted, and happiest
near rivers and trees, Gammy’s
world collapsed when his
fiancée Tiffany was murdered
during a break-in while he was
away fishing. His dog River was
the only survivor, and his
loyalty to the animal is the
last remnant of his former
life. Unable to bear the
violence and unpredictability
of civilization, he threw
himself into the building of
the new village, insisting that
nature itself could shelter
them better than man’s world
ever had.`

    label: "Ely",
    title: "The Devoted Husband",
    text: `Ely loved his Padres games,
poker nights, and trips to
Vegas, but what mattered most
was his faith and his wife
Becca. One evening after mass,
Becca was struck down by a
gunman who opened fire outside
the church. Ely held her as she
died, whispering prayers in
Latin he had just spoken hours
before. His devotion to her
memory, and his disgust with a
world where even sacred places
are not safe, drove him to join
the founding of the village.`

    label: "Gregorio",
    title: "The Healer Who Couldn't Save",
    text: `Gregorio worked tirelessly
between school and his job,
dreaming of healing others in
the medical field. But when a
robbery turned violent at a
neighborhood market, his
closest friend was shot.
Gregorio tried desperately to
stop the bleeding, but his
hands could not save him. The
weight of failure crushed him —
not because he lacked skill,
but because he realized the
violence of the outside world
was a wound no medicine could
cure. He became convinced that
the only true healing was to
leave that world behind
entirely.`

    title: "The Dreamer Destroyed",
    text: `Bright and spirited, Raquel
loved the little joys of color,
beauty, and self-expression.
Her life was filled with
karaoke, laughter, and her
friends. But a night out with
friends turned into tragedy
when she was assaulted walking
to her car alone. She survived
— but the lightness she once
carried was gone, replaced by
silence and fear. She followed
her siblings into the village,
hoping to create a place where
innocence and joy would never
again be stolen.`

    title: "The Seeker of Truth",
    text: `Rebecca’s obsession with crime
stories was more than a hobby;
it was a search for
understanding. But when her
closest confidant disappeared,
later discovered to be the
victim of a serial killer, she
became consumed with grief. The
crime podcasts she once enjoyed
became unbearable reminders of
how cruel and senseless the
world was. She turned instead
to the village, convinced that
by erasing the existence of
such violence, truth and safety
could be restored to their
lives.`

    title: "The Youngest, the Bohemian Spirit",
    text: `Mia loved the Beatles, daisies,
and the warm spirit of her
little dog Pooka. But when she
was walking Pooka late one
night, two men attacked her.
They killed her dog and left
her beaten on the street.
Though she survived, the
cruelty broke something in her
— the idea that kindness and
gentleness had a place in the
world. She followed her
siblings into the village,
carrying with her the image of
Pooka and a vow that no child
in their new home would ever
know that kind of cruelty.`
