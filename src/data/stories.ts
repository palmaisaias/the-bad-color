    text: `Her love for music and lavender was eclipsed when her husband Edward was killed in a senseless act of violence during a late-night store robbery. She was left holding their 7-month-old son, Vincent, knowing he would grow up never hearing his father's voice. Overwhelmed by grief and the ugliness of the world, she became one of the first to believe that a village could be built away from it all — where children could grow in safety and innocence.`,

    title: "The Father Who Lost His Place",
    text: `Edgar loved puzzles and logic, always finding structure where others saw chaos. But when he was caught in a workplace shooting at his office, several of his closest colleagues — people he’d spent years beside — were killed in moments. He survived, but could never sit at a desk without hearing the echoes of gunfire. With Alexander, his young son, he turned to the village, believing it to be the only place left where order and peace could endure.`,

    text: `Strong, devoted, and happiest near rivers and trees, Gammy’s world collapsed when his fiancée Tiffany was murdered during a break-in while he was away fishing. His dog River was the only survivor, and his loyalty to the animal is the last remnant of his former life. Unable to bear the violence and unpredictability of civilization, he threw himself into the building of the new village, insisting that nature itself could shelter them better than man’s world ever had.`,

    title: "The Devoted Husband",
    text: `Ely loved his Padres games, poker nights, and trips to Vegas, but what mattered most was his faith and his wife Becca. One evening after mass, Becca was struck down by a gunman who opened fire outside the church. Ely held her as she died, whispering prayers in Latin he had just spoken hours before. His devotion to her memory, and his disgust with a world where even sacred places are not safe, drove him to join the founding of the village.`,

    text: `Gregorio worked tirelessly between school and his job, dreaming of healing others in the medical field. But when a robbery turned violent at a neighborhood market, his closest friend was shot. Gregorio tried desperately to stop the bleeding, but his hands could not save him. The weight of failure crushed him — not because he lacked skill, but because he realized the violence of the outside world was a wound no medicine could cure. He became convinced that the only true healing was to leave that world behind entirely.`,

    text: `Bright and spirited, Raquel loved the little joys of color, beauty, and self-expression. Her life was filled with karaoke, laughter, and her friends. But a night out with friends turned into tragedy when she was assaulted walking to her car alone. She survived — but the lightness she once carried was gone, replaced by silence and fear. She followed her siblings into the village, hoping to create a place where innocence and joy would never again be stolen.`,

    text: `Rebecca’s obsession with crime stories was more than a hobby; it was a search for understanding. But when her closest confidant disappeared, later discovered to be the victim of a serial killer, she became consumed with grief. The crime podcasts she once enjoyed became unbearable reminders of how cruel and senseless the world was. She turned instead to the village, convinced that by erasing the existence of such violence, truth and safety could be restored to their lives.`,

They killed her dog and left her beaten on the street. Though she survived, the cruelty broke something in her — the idea that kindness and gentleness had a place in the world. She followed her siblings into the village, carrying with her the image of Pooka and a vow that no child in their new home would ever know that kind of cruelty.`,

  text: `Xochitl poured her heart into the meals she made, believing that food was a language of love. One evening, she invited her closest friends for dinner, filling the table with steaming coffee and her signature stew. By night’s end, a forgotten jar of spoiled preserves had turned the gathering into tragedy. She buried more than recipes that week — she buried laughter, trust, and the life she knew. Seeking a place where sorrow could not reach her, she followed the others to the village, hoping that in silence, her heart might one day be fed again.`,
